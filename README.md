# Time-Series-Visualizer
This project is part of the Data Analysis with Python curriculum from freeCodeCamp. It focuses on visualizing time series data using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

The dataset contains the number of daily page views on the freeCodeCamp.org forum
 from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03.

The goal is to clean the data and create line charts, bar charts, and box plots to better understand forum traffic trends, growth patterns, and seasonality.
